leaflet.ignlayer
================

Simple implementation for showing tiles from the ign geoportail wmts server.

Currently supports:

- Parcel imagery (bd parcellaire)
- Aerial imagery (ortho photos)

Note: There is also this, which appears to be a modification of the leaflet wms layer.
This is a bit of a simplification.
